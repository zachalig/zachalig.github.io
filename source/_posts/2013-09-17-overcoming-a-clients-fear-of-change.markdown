Admit it.  You've been tinkering with a new framework, library or other technology and it’s clicked for you.  It’s amazing, super-efficient, and oh-so-shiny.  You love it.  You just know it would be perfect for that upcoming client project.

If you’re lucky, you already work for a company that has no problem embracing new approaches.  If so, what are you doing here?  Stop reading and go build something amazing!  

In my experience, it’s far more common that new technologies are a hard sell.  All of that passion and excitement a developer brings to the table often dies at project kickoff meetings when they’re told that the new approach isn’t needed or wanted at the moment.  In the past, I’ve simply let it go and completed projects as requested.

I never felt satisfied with that though.  I felt strongly that I was doing myself and my clients a disservice by giving them what they thought they wanted instead of something even better.  I started to consider why they were rejecting new approaches, and seeing if there was a better way to help them take the leap into the new.

User centered design is common practice now, and most people building interfaces spend a lot of time empathizing with users.  This largely involves trying to ‘walk a mile in their shoes,’ which is a way of saying you imagine you’re a user instead of someone familiar with the product.  This is the only way you can uncover potential pitfalls until you get to do some actual user testing.  The question is, how often do we employ a similar empathy with our clients?

The first time this dawned on me was several years ago when I read [this excellent post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/23/how-do-you-deal-with-overstressed-irrational-clients-entrepreneur-view/) by Brian Scordato, an entrepreneur himself.
